#Blogging Website Project

This is a blog I created using PHP, MySQL databases and the Laravel framework.  The index page shows all the posts I've written.  I added the ability for me as the owner of the blog to login, create, edit & delete posts, and logout.  I've set it up so visitors to my site can just read but not have the ability to access any of my admin sites.  I've also set up Media Queries in the CSS file in order for the site to adjust depending on site of the screen of the visitor. 

###Technolgies Used
HTML | CSS | PHP | Twitter Bootstrap | Laravel

On a sidenote, I've made this blog for me to journal my career change going from sales support rep to Codeup student to programmer.
